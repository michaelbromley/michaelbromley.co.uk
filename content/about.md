### Hi! I'm am a software developer originally from Manchester, England and now based in Vienna, Austria.

{{< figure src="/assets/speaking.jpg" title="Speaking about creative coding at WeAreDevs 2017" >}}

I've been making computers do things since I was in my teens, with varying degrees of success. Currently I mostly do front-end web development and specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular.

In my free time - when not with my wonderful wife and two boys - I like to explore my other interests of art, music, writing and their interesection with code. You can see the result of some of my experimentation on the projects page.

If you'd like to get in touch, [email me](mailto:michael@michaelbromley.co.uk) or, for a faster but possibly less thoughtful response, hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/michlbrmly).
