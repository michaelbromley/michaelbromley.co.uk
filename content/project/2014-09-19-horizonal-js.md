Horizonal.js takes any static HTML document and transforms it into a collection of discrete &#8220;pages&#8221;. The transitions between one page an the next can then be programmed via CSS transforms, CSS animations, JavaScript, or any combination of these.

I made this after I read David Desandro's [Intro to CSS 3D Transforms](http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/) and became fascinated with the idea that any DOM element can be transformed in 3D and animated.

Caution: Horizonal can be used for some pretty horrific and unnecessarily over-the-top transitions (as you&#8217;ll see in the demo), so use with caution!
