Open source software (OSS) is often made for free by developers who simply love to do it. This can result in great software, guided by a high degree of integrity. On the other hand, this model can also result in an unsustainable burden on maintainers - a fact which will be familiar to anyone who has done much work in open source. 

Recently my essay Why I Haven't Fixed Your Issue Yet - which details my own struggles as a maintainer - generated quite a bit of discussion on Medium. It got me interested in the question of whether the role of an OSS maintainer can be made more sustainable by adding some kind of financial reward for the work they do. I went in search of approaches which have been attempted and reached out to other maintainers to find out any successful actions. This post is a summary of my findings.

## The Problem - Time

Most open source projects are maintained by one or very few maintainers who typically work on those projects in their free time. When a project becomes popular, the number of bug reports, support requests and other maintenance tasks can quickly rise. At some point, the workload requires more time than the maintainer is willing to spend. The project has become unsustainable. 

There are a few potential solutions to this problem; getting more people to help being the most common suggestion. Another solution is to try to increase the willingness of maintainers or other potential contributors by offering a financial reward for work on the project. As developers, we are willing to write code all day, in large part due to the fact that we are paid pretty well for it. So adding money into the open source mix should solve things, then. Right?
